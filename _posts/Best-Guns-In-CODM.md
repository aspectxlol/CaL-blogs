Hey, you're here to find out what the best guns are for you to use in Call of Duty: Mobile right? Well you've come to the place then! I'm EgXÂ°Delirium, an F2P who has Platinum Camos on ARs, SMGs, MMRs, and LMGs, a load ton of Epic Camos, and also more than 10 Legendary titles, with some having been in the top five thousands. So don't need to worry about the quality of this site. Oh and the meta list here isn't in any particular order, since each gun has their own plus and minuses and will fit for different people. (P.S. The meta in this game changes every season, so.. Yea)

## 10. LW-3 Tundra

Basically the only SR in this list, the Tundra is the best sniper in CoDM. It's lethal hitboxes are from the body and above. It also has a really fast ADS time paired with some absurdly low flinch, which makes you be able to swap the Toughness perk for something else, like Quick Fix, etc. The only main reason not as many people use the Tundra as it should now is it's weird scope in animation, which for some people makes it pretty uncomfortable to use. But I can assure you when you're used to it, you'll destroy!

## 9. Kilo 141
![kilo 141](/assets/blog/best-guns-in-codm/Kilo-141.jpg)

It is old, yet it is gold. Ever since release, this gun has been flattening lobbies with ease, and while nowadays this gun is less used by the community, it sure still is good. The Kilo is used as an Anchor while also having some Flex AR capabilities, because of its lethality at range, while having decent damage capabilities up close. It's iron sight are usable, but it's aimshake is a bit harsh, but it still obliterates.

## 8. SKS
![SKS](/assets/blog/best-guns-in-codm/SKS.jpg)

Only for the elites, this is one of the hardest guns to use in CoDM because of it's incapability to go full auto, and it's low mobility. Yet when you can master it, the enemies will fear you. It is a 2 shot kill gun, and when you hit your shots.. Well, only the snipers can beat you.

## 7. Type 19

Basically the better version of the Grau 5.56, the Type 19 is a CoDM original that is a Jack of All Trades, Master of None. You can use it anywhere at all skill levels, from the noobs to the pros. It's decent at any range which makes it loved by everyone. The only reason people might still prefer the Grau over the 19 is it's horrid iron sights. And that's why I use a red dot on it. It helps, a lot.

## 6. Dr-H
![Dr-H](/assets/blog/best-guns-in-codm/DR-H.jpg)

One of my personal favorites, the DR-H was popularized by the CoDM Championships in 2024, and rightfully so. It has a very high damage profile with a 3 shot kill capability when you hit the chests and the arms. When paired with it's clean iron sights, it makes the DR-H a weapon of its time.

## 5. QXR

My love, my baby, my everything. The QXR is my favorite gun in the game. It has a high base mag, fast fire rate and TTK, and range that can rival even the ARs. There are of course downsides which make it not the best, but I love it, and you will too. (If you don't want Enhanced Bolt, swap it with OWC Laser Tactical for better ADS Time and ADS Bullet Spread)

## 4. KRM-262

Tbh, all the shotties in this game are good, but this is a favorite for everyone. Ever since release, the KRM never fails to obliterate the Garena Lobbies with ease. It has good damage, good range, good mobility, and so on. It just feels good you know? The sound it makes, the.. Idk. Its just the gun you know.

## 3. MG-42
![MG-42](/assets/blog/best-guns-in-codm/MG-42.jpg)

It's really broken. Seriously. The HVK can 3 shot with Large Caliber ammo, and it does so very effectively. Its imo the best gun in the game right now, and it will be that way for a really long time. The downside though is its puny mag size, with only 28 bullets in each mag, so you'll have to hit your shots, or you're cooked.

## 2. HVK-30

## 1. Man-O-War (Thermite Rounds)
![Man-O-War](/assets/blog/best-guns-in-codm/MAN-O-WAR.jpg)

(Imagine that the Extended Mag A is the Thermite Rounds, since I don't have it unlocked) This gun is Haram. It's full auto yet it shoots thermites. It 2 shots your enemies, has obnoxious effects on your screen, and is the pinnacle of brokenly annoying. Use this if you want to be bullied.

Well that's all for this Post. Hope you improve. And please don't use MoW Thermite Mags, or I'll hate you >:(. Just know again that this will change, because each season will have their buffs and nerfs. And feel free to use any gun you want (:
