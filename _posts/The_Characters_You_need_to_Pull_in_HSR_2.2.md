Good day to all the trailblazers roaming around the world! I'm nitrilium, a day one Level 70 F2P player in Honkai: Star Rail. So, Honkai: Star Rail is a Turn Based RPG game that has the Gacha feature. And because of that, the Free to Plays have to select who to pull IF they wanted to fully clear Memory of Chaos and Pure Fiction. So, in this Blog I'll tell you the most Top Priority characters that you will definitely want in order to ease the burden of clearing MoC and PF. Just a disclaimer before we get into this, none of the characters in this game are a MUST PULL, so  if you want a character that isn't in this list, then feel free to pull for him/her, since playing games is all about having fun, and if you think that they are fun, then go ahead! Oh and, all these recommendations are based on the characters being E0S0, which means no duplicates for the character, nor their signature lightcones.

# DPS
1. Acheron
   ![Acheron](/assets/blog/HSRCharacters/Acheron.jpg)
   Lore wise, Acheron is a self proclaimed Galaxy Ranger who, in reality is actually aan Emanator of Nihility, which makes her strong not only in lore, but also gameplay! In fact, Acheron is arguably one of the best DPS in the game. Why? Well, to simplify her kit, she doesn't get her ultimate from the usual energy, but she actually gets her ultimate through getting 9 stacks of Slashed Dreams, which you can get from either using acherons skill, or by inflicting debuffs to enemies by allies or even the enemies themselves, which each giving acheron 1 stack of Slashed Dream. What makes her insanely good is the amount of damage multiplier buffs she gets just from her kit, most prominently seen from he A4 Major Trace, which increases her total damage by 160% of her original damage when there are 2 other Nihilty characters. Her teams, I'd recommend using Pela and Silverwolf for Defense Reduction and Weakness Implant, of course, if you don't have either, you can substitute with any other Nihilty characters, like Guinaifen, Black Swan, etc.

2. Jingliu
   ![Jingliu](/assets/blog/HSRCharacters/Jingliu.jpg)
   Jingliu is a former Sword Champion of the Luofu, a member of the High-Cloud Quintet, and Jing Yuan's mentor. Of course, from that alone we can tell that she's good, like REALLY GOOD gameplay wise, like on par with Acheron. She is an Ice Destruction character that has two states, which are her normal state, and the Spectral Transmigration State (Basically holy crap ton of DAMAGE). She gets access to her ST State when she gains 2 stacks of Syzygy by either using skill or Ultimate (Which you should use in her ST State). When she gets two stacks, Jingliu automatically advances her action by 100% AND gives her 50% CRIT RATE! Like dude, that's insane. Not only that, her Enhanced Skill and Ultimate deals a whole ton more damage becauss she takes a small portion of your allies HP and converts it to MORE DAMAGE, WHILE NOT USING SKILL POINTS. Well, yea.. She's broken. For her teams, I'd recommend Bronya, Ruan Mei, and Pela. If you don't have them, swap with any other supports. She'll still cook the enemies ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

# SUPPORTS
1. Ruan Mei
   ![Ruan Mei](/assets/blog/HSRCharacters/Ruan_Mei.jpg)
   Ruan Mei, a Member of the Genius Society who deepens her studies in Biology and the such. She's arguably the most broken, insane, and versatile unit in the game. Ruan Mei gives a total of about 60% DMG Buff, 50% Weakness Break Efficiency, 25% All-Type RES PEN, and a speed buff, TO THE WHOLE TEAM. Oh and also extra Break Damage. That, is what makes her crazy insane. She gives buffs that no other characters can provide while still being SP Positive. You can use her in basically any team. Whether it's DoT Team, FUA Teams, Pure Fiction Teams, etc. She'll still perform amazingly no matter what, because of her universal buffs.

2. Sparkle
   ![Sparkle](/assets/blog/HSRCharacters/Sparkle.jpg)
   A member of the Masked Fools, she is inscrutable and unscrupulous. A dangerous master of theatrics engrossed in playing roles. Gameplay wise though, she's also very dangerous (from the enemies perspective). Simply speaking, she's an SP Positive version of Bronya. Her skill advances forward an ally (except herself ofc ofc) by 50% of their Action Value, which will usually bring your character up all the way to the top. On top of that, she gives 45% CRIT DAMAGE AND 24% OF HER OWN. If hypotheticaly Sparkle had 150% Crit Damage you'd give your DPS 81% CRIT DAMAGE! THAT'S A CRAP TON OF CD!! Plus, her talent gives you a total of 18% Damage increase + an extra 30% more from her Ultimate. Speaking of which, her ult ALSO GIVES 4 SKILL POINTS FOR THE TEAM! Oh and your SP cap is increased from 5 to 7, so you really don't have to worry as much about SP as you'd usually would. So yea, she's really good. For her best teams, mono quantum, DHIL, Acheron, and the such would be optimal. I mean, you can practically run her with any hypercarry DPS's and make them perform well, so yea.

# Sustain
1. Fu Xuan
   ![Fu Xuan](/assets/blog/HSRCharacters/Fu_Xuan.jpg)
   Fu Xuan is the Master Diviner of the Xianzhou Luofu's Divination Commission and one of the Six Charioteers. She calculates the Xianzhou's route and predicts the fortune of future events. She firmly believes that everything she does is the "best solution" for the situation. Gameplay wise it's a bit different, she negates damage, like A LOT of damage. She is basically the most comfy sustain to play in the game. Her skill activates the Matrix of Prescience, which DISTRIBUTES a portion of the damage taken from any ally to her. Plus, her skill also give some extra HP AND CRIT RATE. So yea, she also buffs your characters offensively. As for her talent, it's basically a Giga Heal, where when Fu Xuan falls below about 55% HP, she'll use one trigger count to regenerate her HP back to (basically) full. Oh and the talent also gives the team 18% DMG Reduction, so you will not die. Oh yea, and her Ultimate damages enemies while also regenerating all allies HP and gives Fu Xuan a trigger count, so basically it gives heals. All in all, she makes your team basically incapable of dying, except when a huge AOE Attack comes, which Fu Xuan will take a crap ton of damage. But, she'll live. Hopefully. Anyways, you can pair her up with anybody really, whether it's Mono Quantum, Acheron Hyper, Ratio, DHIL, etc. She's also universal so yeah.

2. Aventurine
   ![Aventurine](/assets/blog/HSRCharacters/Aventurine.jpg)
   Longs Story short, he a gambler, and he ANITA MAXWIN!!!!! But seriously, he a gambler, and his whole kit is a gamble ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Basically, he gives you a shield, whether it's from his skill or FUA. Yes, he does FUA. Yes, he deals damage. That's why he insane good. You can trigger Aventurine's FUA by getting 7 stacks of Blind Bet, which can be get by either getting his shield attacked by an enemy, or by using his Ultimate, and even by FUA's by allies. His ultimate does a considerable amount of damage while also giving a RANDOM amount blind bet, while also giving the target enemy a debuff which increases the Crit Damage taken by a set amount of percentage. Wanna know what makes him even more gambly? His technique. It has a chance of giving 3 buffs, all of them giving different amounts of def% boosts. So basically you gotta gamble to get his optimal technique buff à²¥_à²¥. As for teams, his best is definitely the Premium FUA Team, which has him, Dr. Ratio, Topaz, and Robin. That team obliterates MoC easily. Other than that, you can also use him in Acheron teams, and any other Hypercarry or doublecarry teams

That's all in this blog. Remember, just because a character isn't in here doesn't mean they're horrendously awful. Like Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae, Boothill, Seele, Dr, Ratio, etc. What is shown in this small list are, in my opinion the most important characters you will really want to dominate the End Game. But even then, even the 4 stars are good, like Tingyun, Pela, and the such. So, if you want to pull a character who isn't in this list, go for it! They are definitely good with the right teams and investment. Anyways, that's all from me. Toodaloo!
